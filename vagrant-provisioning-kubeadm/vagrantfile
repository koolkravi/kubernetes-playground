  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port

  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
